# EcoDC

This frontend will use react and may be hosted without a backend in its minimal viable content form just as a way to spread good information about Ecological activities in DC.

# Notes for future self

I still have not solved the onHover bug with the MUI menu component. Notably the onLeave listener fires immediately after mousing over the component 

I found out out to host any react frontend on your network using "HOST=0.0.0.0 npm run start" to launch the app and the computers IP and port as the url. so to host this project I the url would be http://10.0.1.18:3000.
